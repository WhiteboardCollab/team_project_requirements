# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction
This document describes the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the project. It defines the functional and non-functional requirements that the system must meet to ensure its successful implementation.

## 2. Functional Requirements
The functional requirements describe the essential features and functions that the system must be able to perform. The full list of functional requirements is available in the following view:

- [Functional Requirements View](https://github.com/orgs/WhiteboardCollab/projects/5/views/7?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Assignees%22%2C%22Status%22%2C171667321%5D&filterQuery=types%3AFunctional+types%3A)

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements specify the performance, security, and other operational constraints of the system. The full list of non-functional requirements is available in the following view:

- [Non-Functional Requirements View](https://github.com/orgs/WhiteboardCollab/projects/5/views/10?filterQuery=types%3A%22Non-Functional%22+types%3A)

## 4. System Architecture
The system architecture includes the design decisions that describe the system structure, such as client-server architecture, data storage mechanisms, and communication protocols.

## 5. Data Design
This section defines the data models, database schemas, and structures used within the system. It includes both persistent data (e.g., databases) and temporary data (e.g., session variables).

## 6. Interface Design
The interface design specifies the user interface (UI) and the interaction between the user and the system. It includes wireframes, navigation flow, and visual design elements.

## 7. Performance Requirements
The system must meet specific performance goals, including response time, throughput, and scalability. These requirements define how quickly the system should process user requests and handle load.

## 8. Security Requirements
The system should adhere to security best practices to ensure data protection, confidentiality, and secure user authentication. This includes encryption protocols and secure login mechanisms.

## 9. Constraints
This section identifies any limitations that the system must work within, such as platform dependencies, technology limitations, or regulatory constraints.

## 10. Assumptions and Dependencies
This section lists any assumptions made during the requirements gathering process, as well as external dependencies on other systems, libraries, or services.

## 11. Glossary
This section defines the technical terms and jargon used throughout the SRS, ensuring clarity and consistency in understanding.
